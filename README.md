Simply create a new `DebugCam` instance like this: `DebugCam(<camera>, moveSpeed, turnSpeed)` and then put a call to the `.takeInput()` element of your previously initialized `DebugCam` instance in the `keyPressed()` function of p5.js in order to use the library

To use this library you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/p5jsDebugCam/debugCam.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
